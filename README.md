## Learning about objects on Codecademy

- The **addPlayer** method, takes in three parameters - *firstName, lastName and age* - and adds the player to the nested, **players**, object inside the parent, **team**, object.
- The **addGame** method, works very similarly to the **addPlayer** method, taking in *opponentName, teamPoints and opponentPoints* as parameters, and adding the game to the **game** object.
